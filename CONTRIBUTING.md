* __NSFW images aren't allowed due to [Github Site Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy);__

* Pictures can't be related to cryptocurrency or its technologies;

* Image names must follow the following rules:
    * The general format is Name__Anime__Book.png. Note that the parts are seperated by double underscores. The file does not have to be
    in .png format.
    * The entire file is named in Title_Case with underscores. Special characters should be replaced with underscores unless this would cause an unintended double or triple underscore. In that case replace it with nothing.
    * The Name part of the filename has the family name first, then the given name. So Iwakura_Lain, not Lain_Iwakura. If only part of the name is known or only an alias, use that. If the name is not known or there is no name write Unknown. All names should be romanized, so Iwakura_Lain, not 岩倉_玲音.
    * The Anime part of the filename should use the English name for the anime the character first appeared in. If the character appears in a manga, game or other, than use the title of the respective work.
    * The Book part should use the English title for the book. It should be the literal title of the book, not a shortening or alias. So "Compilers_Principles_Techniques_And_Tools", not "dragon book".

* If a character already has an image with a certain book, try to give some love to a different character or book.

* Add your images to the folder that best describes the subject matter of the book that the girl is holding. If no existing folder applies create a new one, the simpler the name, the best;

* All Characters must be female presenting (either canonically female or look/act like girls).
